# Renewable Energy Analysis
### Highlighting the importance of carbon dioxide reduction and the growth of the renewable energy sector

**Note**: This is a practice portfolio project after the Stackfuel GmbH post exam to become a "certified Data Analyst - Python".

## Problem Description
This project aims to shed light on the critical concerns related to carbon dioxide emissions, global warming, and the emergent renewable energy sector. By analyzing data and trends, we hope to provide insights and solutions to combat global warming and promote sustainable energy.

## Impact
- **Educate the Masses**: Through this analysis, we aim to educate the general public about the dangers of unchecked CO2 emissions and the urgency of the global warming crisis.
- **Promote Renewable Energy**: By highlighting the potential of the renewable energy sector, we hope to accelerate its adoption globally.
- **Informed Decision Making**: Governments and businesses can use this analysis to make informed decisions regarding energy policies and investments.

## Approach
Our approach to this project involves:
1. Collecting data on energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and renewable energy growth.
2. Analyzing the collected data to identify trends and patterns.
3. Presenting our findings in an intuitive and easy-to-understand format.

## Project Tools
The primary tool used for data analysis in this project is a Jupyter Notebook titled `DA_Course_Cleaning.ipynb`. This notebook contains all the data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis steps.
